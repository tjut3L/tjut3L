ðŸ‘‹ Hi, we are tjut3L - TJUT Life Long Learning

Welcome to the digital home of tjut3L, a research group dedicated to advancing the fields of continual learning and adversarial robustness. Our team is passionate about pushing the boundaries of machine learning, ensuring models can learn continuously over time while maintaining robustness against adversarial attacks.

ðŸ“š Our Interests

- <a name="todo"></a>Continual Learning: Developing algorithms that enable machines to learn from a continuous stream of data without forgetting previously learned information.
- <a name="todo"></a>Adversarial Robustness: Enhancing the security of AI systems by improving their resilience against adversarial examples and attacks.

ðŸŒ± Projects and Contributions

We host projects formally disclosed in our academic papers here. Each repository provides comprehensive README files where you can explore:

- <a name="todo"></a>The background and motivations behind each project.
- <a name="todo"></a>Detailed technical descriptions and methodologies.
- <a name="todo"></a>Step-by-step usage instructions for replicating results.
- <a name="todo"></a>Additional resources, including datasets and supplementary materials.
